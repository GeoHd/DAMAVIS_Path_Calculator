# DAMAVIS_Path_Calculator
## AUTHOR: George Hadib Shammas


# Introduction:
A path posibilities calculator for a 2d snake game.
The app was made and tested with python 3.8 but it shouldn't cause problems with older versions

# How to use?
1. Step 1: clone the repository
`https://github.com/GeoHd/DAMAVIS_Path_Calculator.git`

2. Step 2: change current directory to the project folder:
`cd DAMAVIS_Path_Calculator`

3. Step 3: Using the python interpreter, call the function from cli entering the needed arguments. The first argument should be the snake array, the second argument should be the board array and the third one should be the depth.
ps: Please avoid any spaces within the same argument and follow common sence. Otherwise the app will be suspended and will return an error message.
An example of a successful call could be:
`python3 snake.py [[2,2],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]] [4,3] 3`

4. Step 4: Observe the result on your screen
